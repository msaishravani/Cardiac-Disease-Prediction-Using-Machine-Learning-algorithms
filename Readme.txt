Title : PROGNOSIS OF CARDIAC DISEASE USING BIO INSPIRED ALGORITHMS

##Description:

Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. 
This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. 
Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN,SVM, Nwural Networks with and without using Bio-Inspired Algorithms. 
The dataset we used is form Kaggle website.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. 
This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Support Vector Machine 
K-Nearest Neighbours 
Neural Network
BAT Algorithm

** Important**
Before running the file, please make sure to download python and neccessary Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries.

##Libraries Used -
Pandas
Matplotlib 
Seaborn 
Scikit-Learn 

## Procedure:
1. User have to register in the website.
2. User can login after succesful validation form the admin. 
3. User have to add the data required for prediction.
3. After Adding data we can view the added data in the Data view option.  
4. When we click the ML option we get the final result.
5. The resuts shows whether the person have chances of heart disease or not.
6. A graph is displayed which shows the comparison of accuracies of various algorithms.
7. Accuracies are shown.


##To execute the project:
1. Open command prompt and load the project folder.
2. Execute 'python manage.py runserver' command to open the project.
3. Use the user interface buttons to navigate and provide required inputs.
4. Outputs can be viewed on command prompt.
